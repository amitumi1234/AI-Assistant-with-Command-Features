# AI Assistant with Command Features

## Overview

This Streamlit app functions as an AI assistant capable of performing a variety of tasks based on user commands. It allows users to:

- **Check the Weather**: Type `the weather of [city]` to get the current weather information for a specified city.
- **Chat with Assistant**: Type any question or statement to interact with the AI assistant.

**Note:** Due to some limitations in Streamlit, the following features are currently not functional:
- **Play Music**: The command `play [song name]` to play a song from YouTube.
- **Open Websites**: The command `open [website]` (e.g., YouTube, LinkedIn).
- **Search Google**: The command `search [query]` to perform a Google search.
